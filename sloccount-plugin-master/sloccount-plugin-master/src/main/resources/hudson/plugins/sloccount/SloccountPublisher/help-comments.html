Blank lines and comments are not counted to code lines by default. But they
often contain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">Javadoc</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a> documentation which
is tightly connected to the code. This option is considered only in the cloc
report parser and is ignored in the SLOCCount one.
