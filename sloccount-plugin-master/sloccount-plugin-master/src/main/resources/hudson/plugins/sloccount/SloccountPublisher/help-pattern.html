<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Fileset 'includes'</a>
setting that specifies the generated raw
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a> or
<a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/">cloc</a> report files, such as '**/sloccount.sc'
or '**/cloc.xml'. Basedir of the fileset is <a href="ws/">the workspace root</a>.
If no value is set, then the default '**/sloccount.sc' is used. Be sure not to include
any non-report files into this pattern.
</p>

<p>
The report files must have been generated by sloccount tool using the
"--wide --details" options, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
    sloccount --duplicates --wide --details SOURCE_DIRECTORY > sloccount.sc
</pre>

<p>
or by cloc tool using the "--by-file --xml" options, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
    cloc --by-file --xml --out=cloc.xml SOURCE_DIRECTORY
</pre>

<p>
If you are not sure which type to use, prefer <em>cloc</em>. It is able to detect
more programming languages than SLOCCount (Scala, Ant, CSS, ...) and is able to
count also lines with comments that often contain Javadoc or Doxygen documentation.
Cloc is also better portable, SLOCCount requires
<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> or similar environment under MS Windows.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Never switch between SLOCCount and cloc inside one job.</strong>
You would end up with messy trend graph because they name programming languages
differently. Delete all affected builds and rebuild the job in such case to
fix the issue.
